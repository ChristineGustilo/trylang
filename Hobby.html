<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> My Hobbies</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;"> My hobbies are making beaded bracelets, necklace, reading webtoon stories, play board games, online games, watch K-drama, movies and series. <br> I started to make beaded bracelets and necklace when I watched one of Twice videos which is Time To Twice(TTT); they were the <br> one who influenced me, some of the design of my beaded necklaces and bracelets were inspired by them. <br> However, these past few days I started to stop making it because, I ran out of beads. I play games such as roblox, cod, snakes and <br> ladder, and monopoly. These hobbies are like reward to myself from the hell week(hihi). </p>
